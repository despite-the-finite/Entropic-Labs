 * directions in asterisks (`*a small sad squeak*`) and `{name}` tokens. None
 * of that can be spoken, so every route into the voice system — the
 * pre-generation script and the game itself — passes text through the same
 * three functions here. That is the whole trick behind the system: as long as
 * both sides normalise identically, the game can find the audio file for a
 * line without ever knowing that the file exists.
 *
 *   raw case text
 *     → keyText()    tokens resolved the way the recording resolved them
 *     → spokenText() emoji and stage directions removed
 *     → lookupKey()  lowercased, punctuation-free, hashed with mode+character
 *
 * The composition helpers at the bottom exist for the same reason. The engine
 * says several *composed* sentences ("Yes — a bandage.", "Bramble's paw:
 * mended."), and the generator has to produce byte-identical strings, so the
 * composition happens in one place that both import.
