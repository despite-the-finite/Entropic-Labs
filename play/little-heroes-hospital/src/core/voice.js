/**
 * Optional spoken prompts.
 *
 * A four-year-old cannot read "Drag the stethoscope onto the chest", so the
 * game can read it out. This uses the browser's built-in speech synthesis —
 * no audio files, no network, no dependency — and degrades to silence
 * wherever it is unavailable.
 *
 * It is a separate toggle from the sound effects on purpose: a parent may
 * want the bleeps without the talking, or the talking without the bleeps.
 *
 * Lines are QUEUED rather than interrupted. A step routinely says several
 * things in a row — "Good spotting!", then what was actually found, then the
 * fun fact — and cancelling on every call meant a child only ever heard the
 * last one, usually the generic praise. Anything that genuinely replaces what
 * came before (a new screen, a new step) calls `say(..., { interrupt: true })`
 * or `stop()`.
